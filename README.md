# Data-Science-Framework-Santander_Kaggle:v:
* In this kernel we had particularly worked upon the ways of how Santander can use the Machine Learning Algorithms to increase the conversion for the customer.
* We had worked upon continuously changing the learning algorithms to change the things.

## Getting Started
* First Download the Dataset from the link given in the Data Sources field as the dataset was quite large.
* Clone the repo.
* Go to the File and run the .py file through cmd with python3 as the default python version/virtual_environment could also be used in it.

## How Things Are Working
* As the no of the columns were quite high, so we had worked upon the ways of how we can included the problem in it.
* The code is basically consists of the different no of columns and visualisation can be included according to the time.
* visualisation is one of the most important things which we have to consider before any kind of prediction algorithms.


### Technologies:
* Programming Language: Python3
* Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Deep Learning Libraries: RandomForestClassifier
* Visualization:Plotly and Numpy

### Data Sources:
Datasets used for the analysis can be found on the given [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification):smiley:.
### Prerequisites
Pre install all the dependencies before cloning the repo
```
pip install python3 seaborn matplotlib numpy plotly
```
You should already need to have all the dependencies installed already.:boom:

## Built With 

* [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Best Editor for the Code Writing and Debugging
* [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) - All the dependecy are used on Python3
* [Kaggle For Santander kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction) -Get the Dataset from here.
